Performing web scraping on e-commerce sites may violate the terms of service of those websites, and it's essential to ensure that you have the right to scrape the data you're interested in. Always check the terms of service of the website to make sure you are in compliance.

Assuming you have the right to scrape the data, I can provide you with a general outline of the steps you might take for your internship project:

Web Scraping:

Identify the structure of the website and the pages where you want to scrape data.
Use a web scraping tool or library (like BeautifulSoup in Python or an extension in your browser) to extract relevant information such as reviews, product ID, sales, actual price, discount price, and offers.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess the scraped data to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and format data types appropriately.
Ensure consistency and standardization in your dataset.
Data Modeling:

Define a data model that suits the nature of your data. This may include creating relationships between different tables (e.g., connecting reviews to products).
Use tools like Python or Excel for this step.
Power BI:

Load your cleaned and preprocessed data into Power BI.
Create interactive charts and visualizations to represent different aspects of your data. Power BI provides a user-friendly interface for building dashboards.
Dynamic Charts:

Utilize Power BI's features to make charts dynamic. This might involve creating slicers, filters, or other interactive elements that allow users to manipulate and explore the data dynamically.
Dashboard Creation:

Build a comprehensive dashboard that includes all the key metrics and insights you want to showcase.
Arrange visualizations in a logical and user-friendly manner.
Presentation (PPT):

Create a PowerPoint presentation summarizing your project.
Include an introduction, objectives, methodology, key findings, visualizations, and conclusions.
Documentation:

Document the entire process, including the web scraping methodology, data cleaning steps, data model, and Power BI dashboard design.
Review and Refinement:

Review your work to ensure accuracy and completeness.
Seek feedback from mentors or colleagues and make any necessary refinements.
